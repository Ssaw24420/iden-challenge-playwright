# Iden Challenge - Playwright Automation Script

This repository contains a Playwright automation script developed to fulfill the requirements of the Iden Challenge.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create an automation script using Playwright to:

- Check for an existing session and use it if available.
- Authenticate with the application if no session exists and save the session for future use.
- Navigate through multiple pages to access the product data table.
- Extract product data from the table, including handling any pagination or lazy-loaded content.
- Save the extracted product data in a structured JSON file (`product_data.json`) for analysis.
